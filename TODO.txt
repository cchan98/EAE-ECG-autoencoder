Data exporting should work using the export_data.py script
I think the priority is to get train.py working

For that we need the following functions/classes

Task                    Complete                Info
load_config             ✓
ClaimDataset                                    Exists but needs refactoring and support for folds - suggest working from the HML example, as should just use as ClaimDataset(cfg, 'train', fold), like the HML ECGDataset() class
load_model              ✓
load_optimizer          ✓
load_criterion          ✓
get_summary_writer      ✓
cycle                   ✓
save_state              ✓                       
vis                                             Can be left until last. Needs implementing: not used in HML, but was used in T1T2 to create the plots with matplotlib that get saved to disk as a PNG, and to tensorboard. Suggest we implement this after we get it training, so we can visualise the axes/transition points at the end of every epoch
